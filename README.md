## Pymongo

As it is just test project I'm add pymongo as requirement to make installation as simple as I can.

## AMQP

I know about AMQP, I even read some docs about it and use pika to interact with RabbitMQ in some past projects,
but implement AMQP for test project it's madness.
So I make BaseMessageQueue as simple as I can, but compatible with AMQP backend in some way.
